#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n): The number of computations is equal to the size of n. Since they both increase at the same rate then the algorithm is linear.


b) o(n): the function will run n/2 computations. We can drop the constant here. As n increases the function runs will increase at the same rate even though the function itself will run n/2 times.


c) O(n): This is a recursive function but each call is only calling itself once. So the number of functions ran will be equal to the number passed in.
